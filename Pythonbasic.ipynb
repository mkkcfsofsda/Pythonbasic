They can not be used as identifier.\n","\n","# 4 Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","- Resrved words can not be used as variable name.\n","\n","# 5 What is mutability in Python?\n","- Mutable objects, such as lists and dictionaries, can be modified after creation, while immutable objects, such as tuples and strings, cannot.\n","\n","# 6 Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","- Because  lists  can be modified after creation means it value can be changed, while value of tuple cannot be changed once assigned.\n","\n","# 7 What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","\n","- The \"is\" operator in Python is used to compare the identity of two objects. This means it checks whether two variables point to the same object in memory, rather than comparing their values. while \"==\" opretor compares values of the objects.\n","\n","# 8 What are logical operators in Python?\n","- Logical operators in Python are used to perform logical operations on boolean values (True or False). They are commonly used in conditional statements and expressions to combine or modify conditions. Python provides three logical operators:\n","\"and\" \"or\" and \"not\"\n","\n","# 9 What is type casting in Python?\n","- Type casting in Python is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. This can be done either implicitly by Python or explicitly by the programmer.\n","\n","# 10 What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","- In implicit type casting, Python automatically converts one data type to another without any user intervention. While in  Explicit type casting user converts  the data type using built-in functions like int(), float(), and str().\n","\n","# 11 What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","- Conditional statement compares an expression true or false and the flow the control accordingly.\n","\n","# 12 How does the elif statement work?\n","- In Python, the elif keyword is used in conditional statements as an abbreviation for \"else if.\" It allows for additional conditions to be checked if the previous conditions were not met.\n","\n","# 13 What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","- A for loop is typically used when the number of iterations is known in advance. It iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or range) and executes the block of code for each item in the sequence. On the other hand, a while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand. It continues to execute as long as a specified condition remains true.\n","\n","# 14 Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","- Print number from 1 to 10 for loop be used. Say hello while user inputs \"Y\", while loop is used."],"metadata":{"id":"Dyo-LiUwgxta"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Practical Questions ."],"metadata":{"id":"A2GeqMEyguCl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 1.
